2. **HTMLList**: Implement an ordered or unordered list.
3. **HTMLTablesTask**: Construct a table to organize and display data.

## What is this task?

### HTMLForm
In this task, you are required to create a simple HTML form. Forms are used to gather user input in various ways, including text, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submission buttons. Based on the provided task, your task is to replicate the form layout by using HTML tags such as `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<button>`. This task will help you understand how to collect user data through an interactive interface.

Based on the provided task, you will need to create an ordered (`<ol>`) or unordered (`<ul>`) list using `<li>` elements to display the list items. This task is essential for learning how to present groups of items effectively on a webpage.
